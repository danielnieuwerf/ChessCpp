# ChessCpp


Currently refactoring the project into classes.


The ChessApp.cpp file is a working game of chess with every rule implemented
apart from checkmate and Stalemate. These will be implemented as soon as a 
number of legal moves function is defined. Other features such as save game
and replay game have also been implemented in the ChessApp.cpp file.




Skills practiced during this project:
- OOP
- Implementing complex boolean logic
- Reading/writing to textfiles
- Operator and function overloading
- Polymorphism
- String methods
- Pointers
- Hash maps
